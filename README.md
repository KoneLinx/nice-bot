# nice-bot
a nice bot for comfy places (discord bot)

I've only just started to make this bot so expect code to be weird, incomplete, buggy, ... !!!

My goal is to make this bot as versatile as possible. Easily usable for different bots.
But i mostly do this for the experience. Trying to use a new language and following paradigms that are very different for once.
I've learned C++ in the past year, which I find a great and facinating language. But this time I decided to use a different language and ditch all common practices and try to be as not C++ like as possible. Not sure if the code looks any good but it sure opens up a lot of differnet ways to think. Tell me what you think, or what buggs you too. It's all a learning experience.

So yea, here you go. now die trying to understand the code, especially if you're unfamiliar with javascript. I'll try to improve it. also, suggestions are welcome!

Enjoy!
